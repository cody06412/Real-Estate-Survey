# pythonscraping
Scraping script from https://www.fotocasa.es/es/comprar/todas-las-casas/barcelona-provincia/maresme/l with Selenium, Python.

This is a data analysis Selenium project which covers the three parts of a web-scraping project: web-scraping for data, data preparation and data visualization.
The project involves 3 different files: a .py to do the scraping; a .xls for the dataset; and a .pbix for interactive visualizations.

Things to keep in mind:
 - The scraped web has 146 pages, but it's coded just to scrape till the 9th one.
 - Properties as appartments, offices and studios do not appear on the results, it's filtered only to appear houses, penthouses, etc.
 - The project is focused on Maresme, a Spanish county near Barcelona.
